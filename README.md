## Automated Deployments & Previews

This project utilizes GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment to GitHub Pages and Firebase Hosting.

### Deployment Triggers and Conditions

All automated deployments are contingent upon the successful completion of build processes and automated tests. If tests or the build fail, deployment will not proceed.

### GitHub Pages

*   **Target**: Serves the web version of the application.
*   **Triggered by**:
    *   Pushes (or merges) to the `main` branch.
    *   Pull Requests targeting the `main` branch.
*   **URL**: [https://curtcox.github.io/ExpoGallery/](https://curtcox.github.io/ExpoGallery/) (Note: This is the general GitHub Pages URL structure; the actual live URL might be different if a custom domain is configured or if it's hosted under a specific path).
*   **Workflow**: `deploy-expo-web.yml`

### Firebase Hosting

*   **Live Channel**:
    *   **Purpose**: Production deployment.
    *   **Triggered by**: Pushes (or merges) to the `main` branch.
    *   **URL**: [https://mapchatai.web.app](https://mapchatai.web.app)
    *   **Channel ID**: `live`

*   **Branch Preview Channels**:
    *   **Purpose**: Preview deployments for feature branches.
    *   **Triggered by**: Pushes to any branch *other than* `main`.
    *   **URL**: `https://mapchatai--preview-<sanitized-branch-name>.web.app` (e.g., `https://mapchatai--preview-dev.web.app` for the `dev` branch).
    *   Note: Firebase may append a unique identifier to this URL (e.g., `https://mapchatai--preview-dev-xxxxxxx.web.app`). The deployment system automatically handles this.
    *   **Channel ID**: `preview-<sanitized-branch-name>`

*   **Pull Request Preview Channels**:
    *   **Purpose**: Preview deployments for active Pull Requests.
    *   **Triggered by**: Opening or updating a Pull Request (targeting any branch).
    *   **URL**: `https://mapchatai--preview-pr-<pr-number>.web.app` (e.g., `https://mapchatai--preview-pr-123.web.app` for PR #123).
    *   Note: Firebase may append a unique identifier to this URL (e.g., `https://mapchatai--preview-pr-123-xxxxxxx.web.app`). The deployment system automatically handles this.
    *   **Channel ID**: `preview-pr-<pr-number>`

*   **Workflow**: `deploy-firebase.yml`

### Manual Deployments

Deployments can also be triggered manually:

*   **GitHub Pages (main branch)**: Navigate to Actions > `Deploy Expo Web to GitHub Pages` > Run workflow.
*   **Firebase Hosting (any branch)**: Navigate to Actions > `Deploy to Firebase Hosting` > Run workflow. You will be prompted to enter the branch name you wish to deploy.

## Development Tools

- `npx expo start`: Start the development server
- `npx expo install`: Install dependencies with Expo compatibility
- `yarn add expo`: Add Expo to the project
- `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`: Set Xcode developer directory
- `npm install expo-speech-recognition`: Example of adding a specific Expo package

## Branching Strategy

This project follows a specific branching strategy to ensure code quality and stability:

- `main` only accepts Pull Requests (PRs) from `prod`.
- `prod` only accepts PRs from `test`.
- `test` only accepts PRs from `dev`.
- `dev` can accept PRs from feature branches.

This flow ensures that code is thoroughly tested and reviewed before it reaches the `main` branch.
